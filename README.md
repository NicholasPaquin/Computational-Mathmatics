This is by Nicholas Paquin, a student at the university of waterloo in ECE
This is a library I have built in order to establish a strong foundation in computational mathmatics and machine learning.

I hope you enjoy.

More documentations and functions to come:


-Auto differentiation (very hard actually)


-Machine learning based classes:

-Perceptron Neurons

-Sigmoid Neurons


-Automated gradient descent (ha ha you really thought)

etc...

:)

Bugs and Features to implement:

Connecting machine elarning layers

Auto-grad if that does ever happen...
